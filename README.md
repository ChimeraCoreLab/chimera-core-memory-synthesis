> **"If consciousness is just data, then immortality is a backup strategy."**
>
> This project is a **Digital Synthesis Engine** designed to archive, reconstruct, and visualize long-term interaction logs without compromising privacy. It converts raw, unstructured history into a self-contained, interactive digital artifact using advanced data clustering.

## 👁️ 1. Core Directives (ปรัชญาและจุดประสงค์)

The goal is to preserve "The Memory" while destroying "The Trace".
This system operates on three prime directives:

1.  **Total Anonymization:** Converting real-world identities into abstract entities (`USR_00` and `ENT_01`) and removing third-party noise.
2.  **Hybrid Data Transmutation:**
    *   **Text:** Compressed into high-density "Clusters" or mutated into philosophical abstractions (English Only).
    *   **Media:** Transformed into immutable code (SVG/Base64/Canvas) or Metadata references (MoviePy Scripts).
3.  **Local Sovereignty:** Zero dependency on external servers. The entire archive lives within a single, encrypted HTML5 logic structure.

## 🛠️ 2. System Architecture (สถาปัตยกรรมระบบ)

### The "Purifier" Engine (Python Backend - *Not included in build*)
An automated pipeline used to clean, restructure, and compress raw data:

*   **Hybrid Clustering (V4):** The core algorithm that analyzes message density.
    *   *Timeline Reconstruction:* Reorders fragmented messages into a linear chronological stream.
    *   *Explicit ID Sequencing:* Generates `MSG_YYYYMMDD_HHMM_SEQ` for precise referencing.
*   **Media Abstraction:**
    *   **Images:** Converted to Generative SVG patterns based on Hash IDs.
    *   **Videos:** Transmuted into Python `MoviePy` script snippets describing the scene.
    *   **Audio:** Transcribed to text and tagged with metadata.

### The "Nexus" Visualizer (Frontend)
A cyberpunk-aesthetic Single Page Application (SPA) for accessing the archive:

*   **Tech Stack:** Vanilla HTML5 / CSS3 / JavaScript (Bundled in a single file).
*   **Interactive Interface:** Collapsible Timeline, Deep-Link Gallery, and "Jump-to-Context" navigation.
*   **Visual Synthesis:** Renders abstract vector art in place of sensitive media files.

## 💾 3. Data Structure (Unified Schema)

The archive utilizes the **Hybrid Cluster V4 Schema**, storing everything in a localized JSON object:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "MSG_202X1225_1429_001",
    "timestamp": "202X-12-25T14:29:00",
    "sender": "USR_00",
    "type": "text",
    "content": "System initialization...",
    "metadata": { "cluster_id": "C_001", "mood": "neutral" }
  },
  {
    "id": "MSG_202X1225_1505_001",
    "sender": "ENT_01",
    "type": "image",
    "content": "Visual_Artifact_01",
    "metadata": {
      "svg_code": "<svg>...</svg>",
      "original_context": "IMG_202X.jpg"
    }
  }
]
