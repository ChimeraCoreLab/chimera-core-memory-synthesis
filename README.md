## 👁️ Project Overview
**Chimera Core // Memory Archive** is a specialized **Digital Synthesis Portfolio** designed to archive, visualize, and interact with the digital footprint of a specific connection between two entities (`USR_00` and `ENT_01`).

This project transforms raw, unstructured chat logs (spanning 2021-2025) into a structured, privacy-focused **HTML5 Single Page Application (SPA)**. It treats human memory not as abstract thoughts, but as **computable data points**.

### 🛡️ Core Philosophy: Anonymization & OPSEC
This archive operates under a strict **Zero-Raw-Data Policy** for visual assets.
*   **Images/Stickers:** Converted into **SVG/HTML Renderings** or hashed Metadata placeholders. No `.jpg` or `.png` files remain in the core distribution.
*   **Videos:** Transmuted into Python `MoviePy` code representations or metadata logs.
*   **Identities:** All names are purged and replaced with System IDs (`USR_00`, `ENT_01`).
*   **One-Way hashing:** Text content is processed to retain semantic meaning for AI Analysis while removing PII (Personally Identifiable Information).

## 🧩 System Architecture (Hybrid Cluster V4)
The system uses a custom data structure called **"Unified Hybrid Cluster"**:

1.  **Chronological Folding:** Chat history is organized by `Date` clusters, which can be expanded/collapsed to save rendering resources.
2.  **Media Segregation (The Gallery):** All non-text artifacts (Images, Files, Audio) are extracted to a separate **Visual Database**.
3.  **Quantum Linking:** Every item in the Gallery retains a unique `MSG_ID` that allows instant navigation back to its original temporal context in the Chat Logs.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack
*   **Core:** HTML5, CSS3 (Cyberpunk/Terminal Aesthetic), Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+).
*   **Data Processing:** Python (Pandas, JSON) for converting raw `story.txt` into `chimera_db_hybrid_v4.json`.
*   **Visualization:** SVG Generation for "Code-based Images".
*   **Deployment:** Runs locally via Termux or any Web Server.

## 🚀 Usage
1.  **Process Data:** Run the Python script to convert raw logs into the Hybrid V4 JSON format.
2.  **Launch Interface:** Open `index.html`.
3.  **Decrypt:** (Optional) Enter access key if encrypted.
4.  **Explore:**
    *   **Chat Mode:** View the timeline.
    *   **Gallery Mode:** View isolated artifacts.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
This project contains highly personal data synthesis methods. It is intended for educational purposes in **Data Archaeology** and **AI Persona Construction**.
