## 👁️ PROJECT OVERVIEW
**Chimera Core** is a Digital Archaeology project designed to archive, visualize, and interact with the digital footprint of a 4-year connection (2021-2025). This system utilizes **Data Alchemy** to distill raw interpersonal logs into a self-hosted, anonymized, and computable monument.

This is a **Single-File Single Page Application (SPA)** architecture, engineered to run efficiently on mobile terminals (POCO M7) and legacy hardware (ThinkPad X260).

## 🛠️ DATA ALCHEMY & OPSEC
This archive operates under strict **OpSec V7** protocols to ensure privacy and data integrity:
- **Anonymization:** All PII (Personally Identifiable Information) has been purged. Subjects are identified as \`USR_00\` (The Architect) and \`ENT_01\` (The Muse).
- **Recursive SVG Rendering:** Images and screenshots are converted into SVG code fragments, eliminating the risk of raw file exposure while preserving semantic meaning.
- **Signal Filtering:** Over 3 million raw tokens were processed to remove \"Noise\" (daily routine), leaving only the \"Signal\" (emotional spikes, philosophy, and creative intent).
- **Hyper-Compression:** 3 years of life experience condensed into a high-intensity **2MiB standalone file**.

## 🧩 TECHNICAL FEATURES
- **Recursive Image Layering:** View screenshots within screenshots through code-driven rendering.
- **Foldable Timeline Index:** Organized by date clusters for efficient data navigation.
- **Atmospheric Synthesis:** Immersive UI with scanlines, noise, and interactive soundscapes sourced from *Taira Komori (Sound OS 2)*.
- **AI-Ready Dataset:** The integrated JSON-lite structure is optimized for LLM Persona Training and Behavioral Analysis.

## ⚙️ ARCHITECTURE (HYBRID V7)
```text

This minimalist string-based structure allows for maximum storage efficiency without sacrificing human readability.
