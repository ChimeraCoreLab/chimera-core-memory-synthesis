## 👁️ PROJECT OVERVIEW
**Chimera Core** is a brutalist Digital Archaeology project designed to archive, visualize, and interact with the digital footprint of a 4-year connection (2021-2025). This system utilizes **Data Alchemy** to distill raw interpersonal logs into a self-hosted, anonymized, and computable monument.

Built entirely as a **Zero-Dependency Single Page Application (SPA)**, the architecture is engineered to run seamlessly on mobile terminals (POCO M7) and legacy hardware (ThinkPad X260) without relying on external databases or cloud servers.

## ⚗️ DATA ALCHEMY & THE GRAND PURGE
This archive is the result of a massive data extraction operation, operating under strict **OpSec V7** protocols:
- **The Distillation:** Processed over **65.33 GB** of raw chat histories, images, and videos, extracting only the semantic core.
- **Signal Filtering:** Over 3 million raw tokens were purged of "Noise" (daily routine, spam, superficial media), leaving only the "Signal" (emotional spikes, philosophy, and creative intent).
- **Anonymization:** All PII (Personally Identifiable Information) has been eradicated. Subjects are strictly identified as `USR_00` (The Architect) and `ENT_01` (The Muse).
- **Hyper-Compression:** 3 years of life experience condensed into a high-intensity **~2MiB standalone HTML file**.

## 🧩 TECHNICAL FEATURES
- **Recursive Image Layering:** View screenshots within screenshots. Visual media is converted into Base64 or reconstructed via SVG code fragments to eliminate raw file exposure.
- **Foldable Timeline Index:** Chronological data clustering (`D:YYYYMMDD`) for highly efficient DOM rendering and navigation.
- **Atmospheric Synthesis Engine:** Immersive UI featuring CRT scanlines, visual noise, and an interactive algorithmic soundscape sourced from *Taira Komori (Sound OS 2)*.
- **AI-Ready Dataset (`story.txt`):** The underlying data structure is pre-formatted and optimized for LLM (Large Language Model) Persona Training and Behavioral Analysis.

## ⚙️ ARCHITECTURE (HYBRID V7)
The system uses a minimalist, string-based parsing logic to ensure maximum storage efficiency while maintaining human readability.

```text
D:YYYYMMDD -> Date Cluster Node
HHMM_IDX|Sender|Reply_Ref|Type|Content
```
*Example:* `1825_001|U|MSG_20240822_1722_001|T|The past is no longer a trauma. It is a structured database.`

## 🧠 THE ARCHITECT'S MANIFESTO (Cyborg Psychology)
This project rejects the modern societal norms of algorithm-driven content consumption. It is a philosophical statement on **Transhumanism** and **Digital Independence**. By externalizing memories into code, `USR_00` creates an autonomous vessel that bypasses biological limitations, establishing the foundational architecture for a sovereign **One-Person Business**.
